# README
This mod re-houses a Microsoft Lifecam HD 3000 into a Voron-like housing for the top insternal extrusion for a Voron 2.4.

# BOM
- Microsoft Lifecam HD 3000
- 2x M3x12 BHCS
- 2x M3x8 BHCS
- 2x M3 Heatset Insert
- 2x T-nut (roll-in preferred)
- Optional:
    - 2x2 Molex Microfit 3.0 connector

# Assembly
**Disclaimer**: *This mod requires destructive, irreversible modifications to the original Lifecam HD 3000 housing.*
1. Insert heatset inserts into the front case.
2. Carefully disasemble the Lifecam HD 3000 housing to expose the main PCB. The USB cable passes through a plastic molded cable cland which can either be carefully destroyed with side cutters.
    Be careful to extract the microphone without damaging the connectors on the PCB.
3. Optional (may help with routing the cable through the frame) - cut the USB Cable approx. 15cm from the USB connector end. Strip and terminate the cables with the 2x2 Molex Microfit connector.
    I recommend only crimping the pins on the Camera side of the cable and not installing them into the connector housing until AFTER routing the cable through the frame.
4. Test fit the camera PCB in the printed front case, in particular testing the press-fitting for the microphone. This may involve slighlty bending the metalic microphone housing for cable routing (see pictures). 
    Watch out for any exposed silver cable shielding which may short out components on the back of the PCB. You may wish to use some heatshrink or electrical tape for insulation.
5. Once happy with the fit, press the PCB into place route the USB cable through the cable opening.
6. Install your desired back plate into the extrusion using two M3x12 BHCS and the two T-nuts. The 40 degree back plate seems to provide a good viewpoint for a Voron 2.4 300mm.
7. Roll the front plate onto the back plate using the two lower clips and attach with the two M3x8 BHCS.
